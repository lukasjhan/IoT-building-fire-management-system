# IoT building fire management system

## ABSTRACT

As buildings become taller, fire management is becoming more important. We are trying to solve such a problem by using IoT technology.

Using IoT technology, firefighting facilities can be easily inspected, managers can more easily check, and buildings provide users a safer environment for fire.

Details of this project can be found in the documentation.
